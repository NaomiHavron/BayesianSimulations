# BayesianSimulations
R codes for very simple Bayesian simulations (t test, ANOVA) from existing data / fake data

There are two codes, one for a Bayesian ANOVA using fake data (for now, I'll upload my actual data set when the paper gets accepted, and detail what different steps you will take when you have a data set and don't need to fake data); and one for an independent samples Bayesian t test and a single sample Bayesian t test. 

Let me know if you find any errors or would want to see other simulations happening ;-)
